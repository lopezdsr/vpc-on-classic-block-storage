## How are charges calculated?
{: #how-are-charges-calculated}

{{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} is calculated hourly based on the total number of hours that the block storage volume exists on the account until the volume is deleted or the end of a billing cycle, which ever comes first. Hourly billing is calculated differently for a predefined IOPS tier and custom IOPS. See the following examples.

### Billing calculation for a volume with the general-purpose IOPS tier
{: #billing-calculation-for-a-volume-with-the-general-purpose-IOPS-tier}

You provision a 1000-GB volume with the general-purpose 3 IOPS/GB tier, then use the volume for 72 hours before you delete it. The total price for the volume is billed by the hour, as follows:

((1000 GB x 0.13 USD/GB)/730 hrs) x 72 hrs = $12.82

### Billing calculation for a volume with custom IOPS
{: #billing-calculation-for-a-volume-with-custom-IOPS}

You provision a 1000-GB volume with 2500 IOPS, then use the volume for 72 hours before you delete it. The total price for the volume is billed by the hour, as follows:

(((1000 x 0.10 USD/GB) + (2500 x 0.07 USD)) / 730 hrs) x 72 hrs = $27.12
